## üßê Bounty Challenge <a name = "bounty_challenge"></a>

In this Aptos bounty, the foundations from Quest 2 was taken a level higher and the marketplace dApp was pushed to the next level

## üí° Idea / Solution <a name = "idea"></a>

This section described the functionality added to the project.

- Auction System: Implement an auction feature for NFTs, allowing users to place bids over a set period, with the highest bidder winning the NFT. Ensure the smart contract logic supports tracking and updating bids securely.

- Offer System: Create a feature that allows users to make offers on NFTs listed in the marketplace, enabling sellers to accept or decline incoming offers for their assets.

## ‚õìÔ∏è Limitations <a name = "limitations"></a>

- Inabilty to handle fees using escrow method: When a user makes an offer, the offer price should be recieved by an escrow account or contract address but couldn't be used n this project. This makes the project subject to review in the future if it has to be deploed to mainnet.

## üöÄ Future Scope <a name = "future_scope"></a>

- Player vs. Player Auctions: Create a head-to-head auction feature where two users can compete to win an NFT by placing escalating bids, with a countdown timer to intensify the competition.
